This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in TypeScript's type checking related to optional properties. The `printCoord` function expects an object with `x` and `y` properties. However, if the input object is missing either property, the code will throw a runtime error.  The TypeScript compiler doesn't flag this as an error because it allows accessing optional properties without explicit null or undefined checks. The solution demonstrates how to effectively prevent this type of error.
